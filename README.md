# Subtle Data Movement Error in COBOL
This example demonstrates a subtle data movement error that can occur in COBOL programs. The error lies in the data types and the implicit truncation that might not be immediately apparent to the programmer.
The `bug.cob` file contains the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.cob` provides the corrected version.
This bug highlights the importance of careful data type management in COBOL and thorough testing to identify these less-obvious errors.
